# Boyov VFR Project

This repository contains the web-based Virtual Fitting Room (VFR) prototype. The main application lives inside the `frontend` directory.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app should now be running at <http://localhost:3000>.

See the docs inside `frontend` for more details on features and architecture.
