# Performance Optimization PR: Web Worker Implementation

## Description

This PR implements the Web Worker optimization for body measurements calculations, resulting in significant performance improvements, particularly for INP (Interaction to Next Paint) metrics.

## Lighthouse Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| LCP | ≈ 0.50 s | ≤ 2.5 s | ✅ |
| CLS | ≈ 0.02 – 0.04 | ≤ 0.10 | ✅ |
| INP | ≈ 180 ms | ≤ 200 ms | ✅ |

## Changes

- Moved body measurement calculations to a dedicated Web Worker
- Implemented progressive loading for 3D models (stub first, then full model)
- Added useTransition for state updates to prevent main thread blocking
- Implemented throttling for slider updates (16ms interval)
- Added console log filtering for production environment
- Optimized MediaPipe loading with dynamic imports
- Enhanced error handling for WebGL initialization failures

## Testing

- Verified all Web Vitals are in the green zone across multiple devices
- Confirmed no regressions in functionality
- Tested fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Verified worker termination on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
