# Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the files created to address the requirements in the go-live checklist.

## Checklist Documents

1. **go-live-checklist.md** (Dutch)
   - Comprehensive checklist for the go-live process
   - Includes performance metrics, PR workflow, CI/CD, monitoring, fallbacks, and housekeeping

2. **go-live-checklist-en.md** (English)
   - English translation of the go-live checklist
   - Same content as the Dutch version but in English for broader accessibility

3. **PR_TEMPLATE.md**
   - Template for the pull request to merge the `feat/inp-worker-only` branch
   - Includes sections for description, changes, testing, and checklist

## Production Configuration

1. **.env.production.example**
   - Example production environment configuration
   - Includes MediaPipe CDN URL, CSP headers, analytics settings, and feature flags
   - Should be copied to `.env.production` and adjusted as needed

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. **.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for the CI/CD pipeline
   - Implements the pipeline requirements: lint, build, test, lighthouse-ci
   - Includes performance budget checks (CLS ≤ 0.08, INP ≤ 190 ms)
   - Handles deployment to Vercel (preview) and CloudFront (production)
   - Includes a job for monitoring performance alerts

## Production Fallbacks

1. **app/components/SkeletonAvatar.tsx**
   - Skeleton placeholder for the avatar when loading takes too long
   - Shows after a configurable timeout (default: 1000ms)
   - Prevents layout shifts with fixed dimensions

2. **app/components/WebGLFallback.tsx**
   - Fallback for browsers that don't support WebGL 2
   - Similar to `<noscript>` but for WebGL capabilities
   - Provides helpful information and links to modern browsers

3. **app/components/VFRViewerWithFallbacks.tsx**
   - Integration component that combines VFRViewerWrapper with the fallbacks
   - Handles WebGL support detection
   - Implements the skeleton fallback for slow loading

## Real-User Monitoring

1. **app/utils/vitals-monitoring.ts**
   - Implementation of Web Vitals monitoring
   - Logs LCP, CLS, INP, and other metrics to a configurable endpoint
   - Includes threshold checks for alerting (CLS > 0.10, INP > 250ms)
   - Requires the `web-vitals` package (added to package.json)
   - Includes inline type declarations to avoid TypeScript errors before the package is installed

## Package Dependencies

1. **package.json** (updated)
   - Added `web-vitals` dependency for performance monitoring

## Integration Guide

To implement these changes:

1. Copy the `.env.production.example` to `.env.production` and adjust values
2. Install the new dependency: `npm install`
3. Add the `<WebGLFallback />` component to your app layout
4. Replace `<VFRViewerWrapper />` with `<VFRViewerWithFallbacks />` where needed
5. Initialize the Web Vitals monitoring in your app:

```typescript
// In app/layout.tsx or similar
import { reportWebVitals } from './utils/vitals-monitoring';

// Call this function to start monitoring
reportWebVitals();
```

6. Set up the CI/CD pipeline by adding the required secrets to your GitHub repository
7. Use the PR template when opening the pull request for the `feat/inp-worker-only` branch

## TypeScript Configuration

The project had some TypeScript errors related to conflicting WebGL type definitions and web-vitals type issues. These errors occurred because there were duplicate type definitions for WebGL interfaces in different files and issues with the web-vitals type definitions.

We've implemented the following fixes:

1. Uninstalled the @types/webgl2 and @types/webgl-ext packages to remove direct WebGL type conflicts
2. Upgraded web-vitals from 3.5.2 to 3.3.0 to fix type definition issues
3. Updated the vitals-monitoring.ts file to use proper type imports from web-vitals
4. Set `skipLibCheck: true` in tsconfig.json to handle remaining conflicts in transitive dependencies

These changes have successfully resolved all TypeScript errors in our own code. The skipLibCheck setting is still needed to handle remaining conflicts in transitive dependencies, which is a common practice for projects with complex dependencies.

For a more permanent solution in the future, you could:
1. Identify and remove all transitive dependencies that include WebGL type definitions
2. Configure TypeScript to load only one lib if you have "webgl2" in the "lib" array
3. Upgrade TypeScript if you're using an older version

## Performance Optimizations Summary

The implemented changes address the performance requirements by:

1. **Offloading heavy calculations to a Web Worker**
   - Body measurements are calculated in a separate thread
   - Prevents blocking the main thread during calculations

2. **Progressive loading of 3D models**
   - Stub model is loaded first, then the full model
   - Uses Draco compression for efficient 3D model transfer

3. **React optimizations**
   - useTransition for state updates
   - Throttling for slider updates
   - Dynamic imports with SSR disabled for 3D components

4. **Fallbacks for edge cases**
   - Skeleton placeholder for slow loading
   - WebGL fallback for unsupported browsers

5. **Real-user monitoring**
   - Tracks Web Vitals metrics in production
   - Alerts on threshold violations
