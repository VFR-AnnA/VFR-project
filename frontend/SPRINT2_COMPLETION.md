# Sprint 2 Completion - Progressive LOD with Draco Compression

## Summary
Implemented progressive level of detail (LOD) loading for 3D models using Draco compression and simplified stub models. This improves initial load performance and user experience by showing a low-quality model quickly, then replacing it with a high-quality compressed model.

## Details
- Installed and configured gltf-transform CLI and extensions.
- Compressed mannequin.glb with Draco compression.
- Generated a simplified stub model for fast initial display.
- Implemented React component (VFRViewer.tsx) for progressive loading using @react-three/drei's useGLTF hook.
- Uploaded models to Cloudflare R2 and deployed Cloudflare Worker.
- Verified performance metrics locally and on edge.

## Performance Metrics
- Stub model size: ~301 kB (target ≤ 50 kB)
- Draco model size: ~271 kB (target ≤ 150 kB)
- Edge TTFB and download times measured with curl.

## Next Steps
- Further optimize model sizes to meet target thresholds.
- Update documentation and demo deck with network waterfall screenshots and curl results.
- Open PR for review and merge to main branch.
- Tag release as v0.3.0-draco-lod.
- Conduct end-to-end smoke tests on staging environment.
