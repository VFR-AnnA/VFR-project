# Realistic Mannequin Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to improve the realism of the mannequin model while maintaining performance, specifically keeping INP (Interaction to Next Paint) under 200ms.

## 1. Mannequin Realism Improvements

### 1.1 Model Loading Optimization

We've implemented a new model loading system that supports:

- **Draco Compression**: Reduces geometry size by up to 90%
- **KTX2 Textures**: Provides efficient texture compression with BasisU/ETC2
- **Progressive LOD Loading**: Starts with a low-poly stub and upgrades to HD mesh after first interaction

The implementation includes:

- `modelLoaders.ts`: A utility for handling compressed models and textures
- `RealisticAvatar.tsx`: A new component that uses these utilities
- Updated `VFRViewer.tsx` to use the new RealisticAvatar component

### 1.2 Texture Baking

The system now supports baked textures:

- Diffuse maps (albedo)
- Normal maps for surface detail
- Ambient occlusion maps for depth cues

This approach creates the illusion of high detail without requiring high polygon counts.

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### 2.1 React Three Fiber Optimizations

- Set `frameloop="demand"` to only render when needed
- Only call `invalidate()` when there's an actual change
- Implemented proper cleanup of controls and resources

### 2.2 Main Thread Optimizations

- Used `requestIdleCallback` and `setTimeout` to avoid blocking the main thread
- Implemented throttling for slider interactions
- Added passive event listeners for touch events
- Memoized expensive calculations with `useMemo` and `useCallback`

### 2.3 Web Worker Utilization

- Moved CPU-intensive work to a non-blocking approach
- Implemented proper state transitions with React's `useTransition`
- Optimized worker communication

## 3. INP Monitoring and Testing

### 3.1 Real-time Monitoring

- Created `inp-monitoring.ts` utility for tracking INP metrics
- Updated `useWebVitals` hook to include INP monitoring
- Added detailed logging and recommendations for improvement

### 3.2 CI/CD Integration

- Added `check-inp-performance.js` script for automated testing
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for INP performance testing
- Set up thresholds and reporting mechanisms

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Package Dependencies

Added the following dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ktx-parse": "^0.7.0",
    "three-mesh-bvh": "^0.7.0",
    "three-stdlib": "^2.29.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "draco3d": "^1.5.7",
    "puppeteer": "^21.9.0",
    "start-server-and-test": "^2.0.3",
    "@web-vitals/element": "^1.0.0",
    "vitest-vitals": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Model Requirements

For optimal results, the mannequin model should:

- Have 8-12k vertices (low-poly but realistic)
- Include UV mapping for textures
- Have named body parts for proper scaling
- Be available in both stub (low-poly) and full (medium-poly) versions

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Development

During development, you can monitor INP performance in real-time:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The console will show INP metrics and recommendations.

### 5.2 Testing

To test INP performance locally:

```bash
npm run test:inp
```

### 5.3 CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically test INP performance on push and pull requests.

## 6. Future Improvements

- Implement texture streaming for even larger textures
- Add support for morphing between different body types
- Implement animation blending for smoother transitions
- Add support for clothing and accessories
- Optimize further for mobile devices
