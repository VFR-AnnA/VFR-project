# Refine + Texture Flow Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

We've successfully implemented the "Refine + Texture" flow to generate high-resolution PBR textures instead of white clay-mesh models. This implementation follows the workflow described in the requirements.

### Key Components

1. **Two-Step Generation Process**:
   - Preview step generates the basic model structure
   - Refine step adds high-quality PBR textures with customizable materials

2. **Improved Polling Strategy**:
   - Exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 15s) reduces API load
   - Extended timeout periods (up to 10 minutes) handle complex models
   - Better error handling with clear timeout messages

3. **Feature Flag System**:
   - Created a feature flag configuration in `app/config/featureFlags.js`
   - Implemented `REFINE_PBR` flag (enabled by default in production)
   - Added support for future features (`CDN_CACHING`, `CREDIT_TRACKING`)

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/PBR-TEXTURES.md` explaining the implementation details
   - Created `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with instructions for merging and future enhancements

### Files Modified

- `app/api/generate/route.ts`: Added refine step with PBR textures
- `app/config/featureFlags.js`: Added feature flag system
- `docs/PBR-TEXTURES.md`: Documentation for the implementation
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`: Guide for future enhancements
- `package.json`: Fixed dependency issues

## Next Steps

1. **Merge to Main Branch**:
   ```bash
   # Checkout the main branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Merge your feature branch
   git merge feature/refine-texture-flow
   
   # Push to remote
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - **Progress Overlay with SWR/React-Query**: Real-time progress tracking UI
   - **CDN Copy and Caching**: Store models in R2/S3 for faster access
   - **Credit Dashboard**: Admin panel for monitoring usage

## Development Tips

For faster development iterations:
- Use `quality:"draft"` parameter during development
- Enable `embed:true` to include textures in the GLB file
- Disable PBR when only testing model shape

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the refine step timing out:
- Check Meshy Dashboard to verify if the job is queued or running
- Simplify prompts during development
- Use 'draft' quality for faster development iterations
- Consider implementing an asynchronous workflow for production

The implementation now successfully generates high-quality PBR textures with realistic materials, significantly improving the visual quality of the generated models, with the ability to control this feature through feature flags.
