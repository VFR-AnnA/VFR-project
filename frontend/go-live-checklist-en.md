# Top Results â€” Ready to Go Live!

## Performance Metrics

Your latest run shows stable results: we now have a Lighthouse-green setup

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| LCP | â‰ˆ 0.50 s | â‰¤ 2.5 s | âœ… |
| CLS | â‰ˆ 0.02 â€“ 0.04 | â‰¤ 0.10 | âœ… |
| INP | â‰ˆ 180 ms | â‰¤ 200 ms | âœ… |

All Web Vitals are well within the green zone, without significant fluctuation. This completes the performance story, and you can safely proceed to production. ðŸŽ‰

## Final "Go-Live" Checklist

### Complete Pull Request

- [ ] Branch `feat/inp-worker-only` â†’ Open PR
- [ ] Add the Lighthouse screenshot and changelog (above)
- [ ] At least one reviewer must 'Approve' + squash-merge

### CI / CD

- [ ] In the pipeline:
  - [ ] `npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test && lighthouse-ci`
  - [ ] Budget: CLS â‰¤ 0.08, INP â‰¤ 190 ms
- [ ] Automatic deployment to Vercel / CloudFront after a green build

### Real-User Monitoring

- [ ] Enable Next.js Analytics or Web-Vitals.js and log LCP/CLS/INP to e.g., Logflare, Sentry, or Datadog
- [ ] Set alarm for > 0.10 CLS or > 250 ms INP (90th percentile)

### Production Fallbacks

- [ ] Show skeleton-avatar when the worker takes > 1s
- [ ] Handle WebGL initialization failures with a `<noscript>`-like overlay (rare browsers without WebGL 2)

### Housekeeping

- [ ] `.env.production` with correct MediaPipe CDN URL + CSP headers
- [ ] Set console.info / warn filtering only in NODE_ENV==="production"

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Web Worker for Calculations**
   - All body measurements are calculated in a separate thread
   - Prevents blocking the main thread during heavy calculations

2. **Progressive Loading**
   - Stub model is loaded first (mannequin-stub.glb)
   - Full model is loaded afterward (mannequin-draco.glb)
   - Draco compression for efficient 3D model transfer

3. **React Optimizations**
   - useTransition for state updates
   - Throttling for slider updates (16ms)
   - Dynamic imports with SSR disabled for 3D components

4. **MediaPipe Optimizations**
   - Dynamic imports to avoid Next.js build issues
   - CDN loading for MediaPipe models
   - Console logs filtering in production

5. **Rendering Optimizations**
   - Optimized Three.js settings
   - logarithmicDepthBuffer for better z-fighting prevention
   - Preloading of 3D models
