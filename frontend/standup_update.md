# Standup Update

## Progress
- ✅ npm run dev works locally on Node 22 (instead of Node 20)
- ✅ Application is running successfully at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Committed changes to feature/dark-mode branch
- ✅ Switched to feature/webgpu-viewer branch
- ✅ Confirmed 3D dependencies are already installed (three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei)

## Notes
- We attempted to install and use nvs to switch to Node 20 LTS, but encountered some configuration issues
- The application is currently running on Node 22.14.0, which is not officially supported by Next.js 14
- However, the application is working fine without any visible issues

## Next Steps
- Test the dev server on the feature/webgpu-viewer branch
- Commit and push changes to feature/webgpu-viewer branch
- Add .nvmrc file to pin Node version to 20 LTS (optional)
