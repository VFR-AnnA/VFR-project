# Standup Update

## Progress
- ✅ npm run dev works locally on Node 22 (instead of Node 20)
- ✅ Application is running successfully at http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- We attempted to install and use nvs to switch to Node 20 LTS, but encountered some configuration issues
- The application is currently running on Node 22.14.0, which is not officially supported by Next.js 14
- However, the application is working fine without any visible issues
- We already have the required 3D dependencies installed (three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei)

## Next Steps
- Create feature branch: feature/webgpu-viewer
- Commit and push changes
